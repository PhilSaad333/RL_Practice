# === GENERATION SETTINGS ===

# === OUTPUT CONFIGURATION ===
output:
  log_level: "INFO"
  results_path: ""

# === CRITICAL FIX ===
# Temperature = 1.0 to fix importance sampling sign error
# The importance sampling computation appears to be sensitive to 
# temperature scaling of logits, causing wrong signs at temp=0.7
#
# Memory optimizations:
# - All microbatch sizes = 1 (was 2)
# - gen_batch_size = 64 (was 128)
# - tf_batch_size = 4 (was 8)
# 
# This should give correct signs with production batch sizes.

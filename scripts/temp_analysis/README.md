# Temporary Analysis Scripts

This folder contains one-off scripts used for data analysis, comparison studies, and experimental result processing. These scripts are typically created for specific analysis tasks and may not be reused frequently.

## Current Scripts

- `extract_training_metrics.py`: Extracts GNS and other training metrics from tensorboard event files

## Usage Notes

- Scripts in this folder are meant for temporary analysis tasks
- They may have hardcoded paths or specific dataset assumptions
- Consider moving frequently-used scripts to the main scripts/ folder
- Clean up old scripts periodically to avoid clutter

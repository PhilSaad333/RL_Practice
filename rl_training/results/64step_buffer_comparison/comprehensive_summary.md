**Date**: August 23, 2025  
**Experimenter**: Lord Krang  
**Model**: Qwen2.5-1.5B with LoRA fine-tuning  
**Hardware**: 2x H100 80GB GPUs on Lambda Cloud  

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive analysis combines evaluation metrics (pass rates, pass@k) with training dynamics (GNS noise-to-signal ratios) to provide a complete picture of how buffer size affects PPO training stability and performance.

**Key Finding**: Buffer size 256 achieves the best combination of:
- **Highest evaluation performance** (60.90% pass rate)
- **Most stable training dynamics** (4.74 GNS noise-to-signal ratio)

## Configurations Compared

| Configuration | Buffer Size | Batch Size | Final Pass Rate | Final GNS Noise-to-Signal | Training Stability |
|---------------|-------------|------------|----------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| Baseline      | 64          | 64         | 57.73%         | 6.45                     | Moderate          |
| Intermediate  | 128         | 128        | 58.98%         | 10.37                    | **Least Stable**  |
| **Optimal**   | **256**     | **32**     | **60.90%**     | **4.74**                 | **Most Stable**   |

## Training Dynamics Analysis

### Gradient Noise Scale (GNS) Results

The GNS noise-to-signal ratio is a critical metric for understanding training stability:

- **Lower values** = More stable, consistent gradients
- **Higher values** = Noisier, less reliable gradient updates

**Final GNS Noise-to-Signal Ratios:**
1. **Buffer 256**: 4.74 (most stable)
2. **Batch 64**: 6.45 (moderate)  
3. **Batch 128**: 10.37 (least stable)

### Key Insights

1. **Inverse Relationship**: Interestingly, batch size 128 showed the **worst** training stability despite middle-tier performance
2. **Buffer Size Wins**: The largest buffer (256) provides both best performance AND best stability
3. **Sweet Spot**: Buffer size 256 with smaller batch size (32) optimizes both metrics

## Performance Progression

### Pass Rate Evolution (Steps 20-60)

| Step | Batch 64 | Batch 128 | Buffer 256 | Buffer 256 Advantage |
|------|----------|-----------|------------|---------------------|
| 20   | 55.56%   | 56.58%    | **56.85%** | +1.29%              |
| 30   | 56.46%   | 57.29%    | **57.28%** | +0.82%              |
| 40   | 57.06%   | 57.39%    | **58.54%** | +1.48%              |
| 50   | 56.27%   | 58.34%    | **59.27%** | +3.00%              |
| 60   | 57.73%   | 58.98%    | **60.90%** | +3.17%              |

### Pass@k Performance (Step 60)

| Metric | Batch 64 | Batch 128 | Buffer 256 | Improvement |
|--------|----------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Pass@1 | 58.53%   | 60.08%    | **61.12%** | +2.59%      |
| Pass@4 | 83.56%   | 84.38%    | **85.83%** | +2.27%      |
| Pass@8 | 91.21%   | 91.21%    | **92.04%** | +0.83%      |

## Technical Implications

### Why Buffer Size 256 Works Best

1. **More Diverse Experience**: Larger buffer collects more varied rollout experiences
2. **Stable Policy Updates**: Lower GNS indicates more consistent gradient directions  
3. **Reduced Overfitting**: Better generalization from diverse experience replay
4. **Efficient Computation**: Smaller batch size (32) maintains efficiency while buffer provides stability

### Training Efficiency

Despite using a smaller batch size, Buffer 256 configuration:
- Maintains similar GPU utilization (99% during training)
- Achieves better sample efficiency (higher performance per training step)
- Shows most stable convergence (lowest GNS noise-to-signal)

## Recommendations

### For Production Training:
- **Use buffer_size=256** with batch_size=32
- Monitor GNS noise-to-signal ratio during training
- Target GNS < 5.0 for stable convergence

### For Future Research:
1. Test buffer sizes 512, 1024 to find upper limit
2. Investigate GNS vs buffer size relationship more systematically  
3. Validate findings on larger models (7B, 14B parameters)
4. Test generalization to other mathematical reasoning datasets
